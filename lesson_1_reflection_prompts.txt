How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?


It made a huge difference from doing it manually, it was efficient and time saving


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?

It will save me time, it will make finding bugs a lot faster, it will make it easier to fix mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
 docs does?

    
Pros: if a mistake was made, you could know which version had that mistake right away
Cons: unless you create a commit, nothing will be saved or updated


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
 files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because G-Docs has to handle automatic saving, while Git is more concerned about changes made to files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows the whole commit history, git diff shows changes between commits



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?


Since you can go back to the previous working version, you have less worries of breaking something



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My own work and personal projects
