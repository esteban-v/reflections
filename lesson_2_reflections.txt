What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A git metadata is created to start keeping track of your files. If you don't initialiaze a repository won't be created and files won't be tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's the middle area where you put only what you would like to be committed to your repository, it could be said it's kind of a check list of what you want to commit
