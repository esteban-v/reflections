When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Specially when you want to collaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be changes you don't want yet to modify your local version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used on github and are used to clone a repo. directly to your github account
Clones are copies of a particular repo. and are used to copy a desired repo. to your local machine
Branches are parallel lines of your main line

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That will give you the base to later know what has changed

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be really hard to collaborate without git and/or github, it would be way harder to email copies of your files back and forth

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to first feedback from collaborators you would want to use a different branch, also when you don't to risk breaking something in your master branch or introducing a bug.
